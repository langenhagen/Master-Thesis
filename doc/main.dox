"The Unsupervised Detection of Salient Regions in Image Databases" provides a solution to find
salient regions of images in image databases. Through the salient regions a clustering of the images
is made possible in order to organize the images or to find outstanding images.

There are three C++ applications. The "FeatureGenerator", the "Clusterer" and the "Evaluation" application.
The solution one other project named "Common" that maintains public functions of broad usage.

The solution is written in the course of of the master thesis 
"The Unsupervised Detection of Salient Regions in Image Databases" by Andreas Langenhagen
for the Computer Vision department at the computer science faculty at TU Berlin.


You may use it as you wish, it is in the public domain.
	

##Getting Started
The first application that should be used is the FeatureGenerator. It creates descriptors to all specified image files.

The Clusterer structurizes the images according to a feature vector clustering.

The Evaluation software enables evaluating the clustering results.


Information about the usage of the applications can be found in the <A HREF="..\..\README.txt">README</A> file.

##External libraries

The logging module uses the rlutil library by Tapio Vierros

The OPTICS clustering class relies on the external library Persistence1D by Yeara Kozlov and
